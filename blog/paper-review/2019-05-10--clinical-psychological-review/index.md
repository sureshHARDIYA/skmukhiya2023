Higher ICC suggests higher IRR. ICC 1 indicates perfect agreement. -1 Suggest strong disagreement.

## Discussion

1.  The results of analysis shows that agreement is low for most of the disorders. \

- _Excellent Agreement_ (ICC between 0.75 and 1): GAD, Specific Phobias, bulimia nervosa, OCT
- _Good Agreement_ (ICC between 0.60 and 0.74): Anorexia nervosa, Schizophrenia, ADHD
- _Low Agreement_ (ICC between 0.40 and 0.59): Panic Disorder, SAD, PTSD, Personality Disorder.
- _Poor Agreement_ (ICC less than 0.40): All others.

2.  Several reasons for these low level disagreement are discussed in the paper including: organisation's biases; the fact that different organisations used different study to determine their effectiveness; different criteria used by different organisations to evaluate treatments; evidences were made at different time periods.

The study compare evidence provided by for leading International organisations on different psychological treatments for the principal adults mental disorders. From the main findings, it should be highlighted that there is no consensus regarding the evidence presented to support the effectiveness of psychological treatments for most mental disorders in adults. The therapies based on CBT models are those that have shown higher level of evidence. In addition, although there are plethora of treatments for many of the disorders mentioned above, not all offer the same quality of evidence to support them. As a result, we need to contribute to improving the quality of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) through more independent studies that promote and contemplate reproducibility as a much more important criterion than evisaged so far.
