Yet another corona filled year has come to an end—an official end of 2021. Like everyone's life, my life was too filled with struggle, fear, many failures, and some success. While I can talk about those failures for days, in this blog, I will express my happiness regarding one of my accomplishments in 2021. 

At the end of 2019, I was allowed to write a chapter for the book entitled **"Artificial Intelligence: Models, Algorithms and Applications."** The task was to write a book chapter explaining AI applications, their current status and their future in any domain. I was very sceptical to write about a topic that I was not much experienced. And I did what every other person in my situation would do, talk to someone who is versed about the subject matter. I spoke with my supervisors and some professors in the field in my case. They mentioned it's a unique opportunity to research the topic as it is highly associated with my current PhD study. As part of my PhD study, I researched developing adaptive systems for personalizing mental health treatments. AI is one of the promising approaches to adapting mental health treatments. So, I accepted this challenge. I started by reviewing past studies, books and old cases. The aim was to discover what has been done in AI and the mental health domain to personalize mental health treatments according to the patient needs and preferences. 

I, along with four other co-authors, started drafting the chapter. We studied previous systematic literature reviews, past studies, case studies, research papers, white papers, blogs, books,  and technical papers. Based on the information compiled from these studies, we drafted the initial structure of the chapter. The chapter we wrote is entitled **"Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health."**

Here is the abstract of the chapter:

*"Managing the prevalence of mental health problems is both socially and economically challenging. Technological advancement in recent decades has provided potential solutions to this issue. In particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the research areas that has expanded into several behavioural, neurological and mental healthcare areas. The primary rationale behind using AI in such healthcare areas is to fulfil the main objectives of P4 medicine - personalized, predictive, preventive, and participative medicine. In this chapter,* 
- *We give an overview of recent applications of AI for screening, detection, and treatment of mental health problems*; 
- *Summarize the economic and social implications;* 
- *Present a systematic overview of which AI technologies are used for mental disorders and identify challenges for further development.* 
- *We identify some future research questions that AI could solve in mental healthcare.* 
- *The chapter concludes with an in-depth discussion on the critical challenges of applying AI in mental health interventions."*

The chapter contains eight sections, including an introduction, background regarding mental health treatments, motivations of using AI in mental health treatments, data collections and preparations for using AI, different AI techniques utilized in treatments for mental health, challenges, discussion about future developments and conclusions.

The chapter discusses different types of AI techniques used for mental healthcare, such as depression, ADHD, social anxiety, bipolar disorder, stress, etc. And we have discussed and reflected on how these technologies will be affecting our near future. 
 
The rest of the book *"Artificial Intelligence: Models, Algorithms and Applications"* presents focused information about artificial intelligence (AI) applications in different areas to solve complex problems. The book presents eight chapters that demonstrate AI-based systems for vessel tracking, mental health assessment, radiology, instrumentation, business intelligence, education and criminology. The book concludes with a chapter on mathematical models of neural networks.

I would recommend getting a copy of this book and expanding your understanding of AI and its applications. 

We will highly acknowledge any comments or feedback on improving the book and chapter for future editions. 

Happy Reading! Happy New Year, 2022! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
