## Abstracts

The trustworthiness of the scientific society and the perception of the public to judge and adhere to new knowledge strongly depends on the authenticity, accuracy, and reliability of the results that have been published. It is particularly important to adhere to ethical norms in research in order to publish such authentic results. This position paper correlates research ethics with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted adaptive technology for providing personalized treatment of mental health problems using adaptive technology. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, provides principled methodologies for the development of automatic, complex, objective algorithmic models for analysis of multi-dimensional and multi-modal biological data. Speech is one of such biological data that can be used in automated detection of mental health morbidities with the application of Machine Learning. This aim of my Ph.D. project is to develop an adaptive technology that can be used in providing personalized treatment to mental health morbidites. In this paper, I examine the ethical
aspects of my project to maintain a higher quality of integrity in research.
